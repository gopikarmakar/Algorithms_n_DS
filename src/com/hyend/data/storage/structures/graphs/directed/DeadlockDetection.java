/**
 * High performance database systems use multiple processes and resource locking.
 * These systems may not provide mechanisms to avoid or prevent deadlock.
 * A situation in which two or more competing actions are each waiting for
 * the other to finish, which precludes all these actions from progressing.
 * Such systems must support a mechanism to detect deadlocks.
 * 
 * Given a state of processes like P1->P2 implies P1 is waiting for P2 to finish. 
 * Detect if there any deadlock situation occurred in the given processes.
 * 
 * Variant: Detect if there any two or more processes trying to access the same resource at the same time.
 * 
 * Variant: Detect if there any process is waiting on another process to finish and release the acquired lock. 
 * 
 * Variant: Detect if there a process is trying to access a resource which is already in use by another process.
